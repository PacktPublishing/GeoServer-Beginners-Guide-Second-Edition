## About the Book
GeoServer is an open-source server written in Java that allows users to share, process, and edit geospatial data. This book will guide you through the new features and improvements of GeoServer and will help you get started with it. GeoServer Beginner's Guide gives you a kick-start to build custom maps using your data without the need for costly commercial software licenses and restrictions. Even if you do not have prior GIS knowledge, you will be able to make interactive maps after reading this book.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter04.

All the code files are present in their respective code folders.

Chapters 02, 03, and 10 do not have any code files.


The code will look like the following:
```
     <!DOCTYPE html> 
       <html> 
          <head> 
               <title>plain WMS</title> 
          </head> 
           <body> 
           </body> 
       </html>
```

Installation and download instructions are described for all the software packages you will need. You just need to have access to a computer with an online connection for downloading packages. The instructions cover both Linux and Windows operating systems, so you may select the one you prefer. All the software used in this book is freely available, most of the time as an Open Source project. Hardware requirements for development purposes are not very high. A relatively modern laptop or desktop will be enough for running examples. The source code and data used in this book are freely available on the Packt website.
